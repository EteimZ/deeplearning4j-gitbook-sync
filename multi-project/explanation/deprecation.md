# Projects

A large number of projects have been deprecated as of release 1.0.0-M1 that happened on May 27,2021.
The changes have been explained [here](https://community.konduit.ai/t/upcoming-removal-of-modules-and-roadmap-changes/1240)
If you have any questions, please feel free to post on the forums.

# Examples

Due to the above project changes, a large number of examples have been removed to reflect the latest changes. If you need particular examples that are older, please see the 1.0.0-beta7 branch.


# Documentation

A large amount of the website's documentation was stale and only hurting the user experience of the project.
Due to this, these out of date tutorials and other documentation have either been moved, updated or remove completely.
If you were redirected from one of these old tutorials, please ask for help on [the forums](https://community.konduit.ai/)
and we will see what we can do to help you.
