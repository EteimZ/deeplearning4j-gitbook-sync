## About Eclipse Deeplearning4j

Eclipse Deeplearning4j is a suite of tools for deploying and executing machine learning pipelins using the java virtual machine maintained by the team at [Konduit](https://konduit.ai/) with contributions from the broader open source community fostered with the help of the [eclipse foundation](https://eclipse.org)

DL4J was donated to the eclipse foundation in 2017 and was started in 2013. It evolved from a single neural net training framework to a big data oriented one, now down to a simpler framework focused on interop with the broader ecosystem making it easier to deliver intelligent applications to the market through a mix of model import, python bundling, and easily accessible hardware optimized math distributed via maven central.
