# FAQ

##  [Why Deeplearning4j?](faq.md#a1)

 With a versatile n-dimensional array class for Java and Scala, DL4J is Scalable on Hadoop, utlizes GPU support for scaling on AWS, includes a general vectorization tool for machine-learning libs, and most of all relies on ND4J: A matrix library much faster than Numpy and largely written in C++. We also built RL4J: Reinforcement Learning for Java with Deep Q learning and A3C.

##  [What's the use case for AI and machine learning?](faq.md#a2)

 AI tools like Deeplearning4j can be applied to robotic process automation \(RPA\), Fraud detection, network intrusion detection, Recommender Systems \(CRM, adtech, churn prevention\), Regression and predictive analytics, Face/image recognition, Voice search, Speech-to-text \(transcription\), and preventative hardware monitoring \(anomaly detection\).

##  [How can I contribute?](faq.md#a3)

 Developers who would like to contribute to Deeplearning4j can get started by reading our [Contribtor's Guide](/contribute).

##  [Is DL4J parallelized and multi-threaded?](faq.md#a4)

 Deeplearning4j includes both a distributed, multi-threaded deep-learning framework and a normal single-threaded deep-learning framework. Training takes place in the cluster, which means it can process massive amounts of data quickly. Nets are trained in parallel via iterative reduce, and they are equally compatible with Java, Scala, Clojure and Kotlin. Deeplearning4j's role as a modular component in an open stack makes it the first deep-learning framework adapted for a micro-service architecture.
